1) The Top navbar changes color from yellow to white when it becomes sticky. It would require JS to implement.
2) The Whatsapp number/ contact us becomes a small icon and sticks to the right when scrolling. Could not implement that.
3) Could not incorporate the lines in how it works section
4) The appearance of the youtube video would require JS to implement.
5) Could not implement dropdowns (could implement but the styling was not exact, so avoided)
